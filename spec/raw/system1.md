# mtree(8)

The utility mtree compares the file hierarchy rooted in the current
directory against a specification read from the standard input.  Messages
are written to the standard output for any files whose characteristics do
not match the specification, or which are missing from either the file
hierarchy or the specification.  For an explanation of the directory
hierarchy, see hier(7).
